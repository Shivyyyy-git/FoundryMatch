Update the “Create Profile” page so that it dynamically adjusts form fields based on the user’s selected role.

🧩 1. Role Selection
Keep the same four role cards at the top, but update the copy to sound more natural and welcoming from the user’s perspective:

1. **Company outside Rochester**  
   “We’re an organization excited to collaborate with students, researchers, or innovative teams.”

2. **University student in Rochester**  
   “I’m a student eager to join a project, build something new, or connect with like-minded peers.”

3. **Professor**  
   “I’m a faculty member interested in mentoring, supporting student innovation, and research collaboration.”

4. **Student in Rochester (with a startup)**  
   “I already have a startup or idea and I’m looking for teammates, mentors, or new opportunities.”

When a card is selected, highlight it with a blue border and a soft shadow.  
Use a smooth Tailwind fade/slide transition to switch between role-specific forms.

💾 3. Save Button
- Keep the “Save Profile” button fixed at the bottom of the page.
- When clicked, it saves all filled-in data including the selected role.
- Show a confirmation toast: “Your profile has been saved successfully!”

🎨 4. Design
- Use Tailwind for consistent spacing and styling.
- Each role form should appear in a rounded, light-gray card container.
- Maintain the same clean and minimal FoundryMatch look.

---

⚙️ 5. Implementation Notes
- Use a single formData object (e.g., formData.role, formData.major, etc.).
- Render different sections conditionally based on the selected role.
- Make the form components modular so each role form is in its own subcomponent.
