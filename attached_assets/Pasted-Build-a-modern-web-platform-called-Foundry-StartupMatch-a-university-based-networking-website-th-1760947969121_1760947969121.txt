Build a modern web platform called “Foundry StartupMatch” — a university-based networking website that connects students with startup and project opportunities at the University of Rochester. The platform should function like LinkedIn but be Rochester-specific, focused on team formation, collaboration, and innovation.Top Navigation BarInclude the following menu items at the top of every page: Foundry StartupMatch, Team Matching, Project Gigs, Startup Showcase, Messages, Admin, and Create.1. HomepageCreate a clean, welcoming landing page with a hero banner that says “Connect. Collaborate. Create.” Add two main buttons: Start Matching and Browse Ideas. Show live statistics that pull from the database — Student Entrepreneurs, Startup Ideas, Teams Formed, and Launched Startups.As users scroll down, they should see:•Featured Entrepreneurs section showing three short profile cards with basic details.•Trending Startup Ideas section that displays a few currently active ideas from the database.•Success Stories section with testimonial cards from previous teams or founders.2. Team MatchingAllow users to:•Browse Teams: View available team opportunities and open positions.•Create Team Post: Submit a new post by filling in basic startup information (synced automatically to the Teams database).•My Team Posts: View and manage their own submitted posts.Each new team post must be approved by an Admin before it becomes visible to others.3. Project GigsSame workflow as Team Matching. Users can browse existing projects, create new project posts, and review their own posts. All projects must go through the same Admin approval process before publishing.4. Startup ShowcaseSame logic as above — users can browse, create, and manage startup profiles. Each profile includes a startup name, short description, founder, and key details. All showcases also require Admin approval.5. MessagesInclude a messaging page that records and displays conversations between users. The interface should look like LinkedIn or Slack — a sidebar with conversation previews and a main panel showing the active chat thread.6. Admin PanelAdmins should have access to approve or reject new Team Posts, Project Gigs, and Startup Showcases. Display counts of pending, approved, and rejected items.7. Database (Dynamic)Keep the backend database dynamic and automatically synced with all front-end actions. Main data types include:•Profiles (id, name, email, skills, interests)•Projects (id, title, description, skills_needed, compensation_type, time_commitment, is_approved)•Teams (id, team_name, members, is_active)•Messages (id, sender_id, receiver_id, content, created_at)•Showcases (id, startup_name, founder, category, description)8. Design StyleModern, minimalistic, and student-friendly. Use University of Rochester colors — navy blue, white, and light gray — with subtle gradients for visual depth. Focus on clarity, simplicity, and a collaborative community feel.
